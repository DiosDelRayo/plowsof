# i2p.svg

i2p.svg should be now in the right format, don't ask how. That was a clusterfuck :D
Couldn't find my script anymore - probably because there was never any - think I remember
I was editing in vim and mangaling the path in the python shell... Well I did this first,
simply dividing all by 16, but seem there is some command that fucks it up, you can see
yourself in ![i2p-scaled.svg](i2p-scaled.svg) , so it the end I tried some things, but the final
result was from inkscape -> vim -> SVGOMG -> vim -> SVGOMG -> ![i2p.svg](i2p.svg).

I dropped you some scripts I found in my old repositories, mybe they are still useful, don't
really know, but I think the `svg2data_image_base64.py` could come handy.
- `png2svg.py`
- `png2svg2.py`
- `svg2data_image_base64.py`

The [index.html](index.html) I used only to check briefly (is claude generated - ugly, but good
to seed quick something.
